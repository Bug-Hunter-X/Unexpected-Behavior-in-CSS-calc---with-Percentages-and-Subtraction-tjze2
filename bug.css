The following CSS rule has a subtle error that can cause unexpected behavior:  .element { width: calc(100% - 20px); }  This rule calculates the width of an element based on its container's width, subtracting 20 pixels.  However, if the container's width itself is calculated and involves percentages, the subtraction might happen before the percentage calculation, leading to incorrect results.
