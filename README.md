# Unexpected Behavior in CSS calc() with Percentages and Subtraction This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in using the CSS calc() function with percentages and subtraction. The bug occurs when the container's width, upon which the calculation is based, is also defined using a percentage. In such scenarios, the subtraction might occur before the percentage is evaluated, resulting in unexpected and incorrect widths.  The `bug.css` file shows the problematic CSS.  The `bugSolution.css` file offers a corrected solution.
